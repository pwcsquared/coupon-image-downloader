# Coupon Image Downloader

This is a tool I built for Sally Beauty. It accepts a list of 6-digit skus in the downloader section to batch-download images intended for promotions. In the second section, it accepts promotion IDs and product skus, and generates a demandware-importable XML file for download so that the downloaded images can be assigned to their respective promotions.
